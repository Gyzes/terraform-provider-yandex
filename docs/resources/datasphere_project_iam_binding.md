# For getting a resource ID you can use Yandex Cloud Web UI or YC CLI.

# IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers;
# first the resource in question and then the role. 

# These bindings can be imported using the project_id and role, e.g.
terraform import yandex_datasphere_project_iam_binding.datasphere.community-projects.developer \
  "project_id datasphere.community-projects.developer"
```
