# yandex_loadtesting_agent




A Load Testing Agent resource. For more information, see [the official documentation](https://cloud.yandex.com/en/docs/load-testing/concepts/agent).

## Example usage

```terraform
resource "yandex_loadtesting_agent" "my-agent" {
  name        = "my-agent"
  description = "2 core 4 GB RAM agent"
  folder_id   = data.yandex_resourcemanager_folder.test_folder.id
  labels = {
    jmeter = "5"
  }

  compute_instance {
    zone_id            = "ru-central1-b"
    service_account_id = yandex_iam_service_account.test_account.id
    resources {
      memory = 4
      cores  = 2
    }
    boot_disk {
      initialize_params {
        size = 15
      }
      auto_delete = true
    }
    network_interface {
      subnet_id = yandex_vpc_subnet.my-subnet-a.id
    }
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the load testing agent. Must be unique within folder.

* `folder_id` - (Required) The ID of the folder that the resources belong to.

* `compute_instance` - (Required) The template for creating new compute instance running load testing agent. The structure is documented below.

* `description` - (Optional) A description of the load testing agent.

* `labels` - (Optional) A set of key/value label pairs to assign to the agent.

The `compute_instance` block supports:

* `service_account_id` - (Required) The ID of the service account authorized for this load testing agent. Service account should have `loadtesting.generatorClient` or `loadtesting.externalAgent` role in the folder.

* `resources` - (Required) Compute resource specifications for the instance. The structure is documented below.

* `network_interface` - (Required) Network specifications for the instance. This can be used multiple times for adding multiple interfaces. The structure is documented below.

* `boot_disk` - (Required) Boot disk specifications for the instance. The structure is documented below.

* `zone_id` - (Optional) The availability zone where the virtual machine will be created. If it is not provided, the default provider folder is used.

* `metadata` - (Optional) A set of metadata key/value pairs to make available from within the instance.

* `labels` - (Optional) A set of key/value label pairs to assign to the instance.

* `computed_metadata` - (Computed) The set of metadata `key:value` pairs assigned to this instance. This includes user custom `metadata`, and predefined items created by Yandex Cloud Load Testing.

* `computed_labels` - (Computed) The set of labels `key:value` pairs assigned to this instance. This includes user custom `labels` and predefined items created by Yandex Cloud Load Testing.

* `platform_id` - (Optional) The Compute platform of virtual machine. If it is not provided, the standard-v2 platform will be used.

---

The `resources` block supports:

* `memory` - (Optional) The memory size in GB. Defaults to 2 GB.

* `cores` - (Optional) The number of CPU cores for the instance. Defaults to 2 cores.

* `core_fraction` - (Optional) If provided, specifies baseline core performance as a percent.

---

The `boot_disk` block supports:

* `initialize_params` - (Required) Parameters for creating a disk alongside the instance. The structure is documented below.

* `auto_delete` - (Optional) Whether the disk is auto-deleted when the instance is deleted. The default value is true.

* `device_name` - (Optional) This value can be used to reference the device under `/dev/disk/by-id/`.

* `disk_id` - (Computed) The ID of created disk.

---

The `initialize_params` block supports:

* `name` - (Optional) A name of the boot disk.
