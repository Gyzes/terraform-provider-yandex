## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `billing_account_id` - (Required) ID of billing account to bind cloud to.

* `cloud_id` - (Required) ID of cloud to bind.

## Import

Cloud binding can be imported by ID

```
$ terraform import yandex_billing_cloud_binding.foo cloud-binding-id
```

**Note**: `cloud-binding-id` has the following structure `{billing_account_id}/cloud/{cloud_id}`, where `{billing_account_id}` refers to the billing account id (`foo-ba-id` in example above) and `{cloud_id}` refers to the cloud id (`foo-cloud-id` in example above). This way `cloud-binding-id` must be equals to `foo-ba-id/cloud/foo-cloud-id`.
