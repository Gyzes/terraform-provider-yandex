## Import

IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers; first the resource in question and then the role. These bindings can be imported using the `organization_id` and role, e.g.

```
$ terraform import yandex_organizationmanager_organization_iam_binding.viewer "organization_id viewer"
```
